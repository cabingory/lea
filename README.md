## Methods
Lea offers two key methods, `get` and `set`
You can use these two methods to `get` values of a component and use `set` to set values of a component.
Components automatically update their display.

The only component which can be used via these methods are booleans, support for sliders will be added soon.

## Examples

Check out `example.lua` on how to use it!
